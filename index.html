        <li>Answer 1: The difference between <b>var</b> and <b>let</b> is primarily their scope. Var is a global declaration, although it can be scoped to a function. Let, on the otherhand, is block-scoped, meaning it is tied to the code block where it appears. Also, <b>var</b> can be reassigned and redeclared, whereas, <b>let</b> can only be reassigned </li>
        <li>Answer 2: The difference between <b>var</b> and <b>const</b> is that var can be reassigned, redeclared, hoisted, and it global in scope, whereas <b>const</b> cannot be hoisted, reassigned, redeclared, and is block-scoped</li>
        <li>Answer 3: The difference between <b>let</b> and <b>const</b> is that the former can be reassigned, but neither can be redeclared</li>
        <li>Answer 4: Hoisting is where a var-declared variable actually runs at the top of the code/scope before it appears elsewhere in the code. They can be invoked before they are defined and return "undefined".</li>
